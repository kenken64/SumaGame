# SumaGame
## Solve Suma!
Our two equations are:
```
x+y=16
xy=55
```
Rewriting equation (1) in terms of just y= something, we get:
```
y=16−x
```
Substituting this into equation (2) leaves us:
```
x(16−x)=55
16x−x2=55⟹x=5  or  11
```
which can be easily seen by factoring or using the quadratic formula. It follows that 
```
y=11|x=5 and y=5|x=11.
```
Thus your solutions in terms of (x,y) are (5,11) and (11,5).

## Another method 
The average of x and y is 16/2 = 8, their product is xy = 55 therefore: x, y = 8 plus or minus sqrt of 8 square minus 55 = 8 +/- sqrt of 9 = 8 +/- 3, x, y = 11, 5

## Game rules
* Given 6 numbers in the array, randomize and shown on the button.
* Guess the correct two numbers that sum up equals to the answer shown on the mobile app.
* Additional to the difficulty a timer ticks from 120 sec and if the timer reaches 0 is game over for the player!
